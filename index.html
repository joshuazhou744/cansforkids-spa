            <p class="text">
                The CansForKids initiative is an
                organization dedicated to bringing vibrance and joy to 
                communities and schools throughout Edmonton.
                We are a team of high-school students
                looking to brighten the public with simple
                garbage cans. If you are a school interested in this
                initiative, please register at the Order Form.

            <p class="text">
                We rely on community grants to purchase 
                garbage cans, brushes and paints.
                All supplies are delivered to schools 
                through volunteers or other means organized 
                by the school. Then the students just paint!
                We take orders through the Order Form. 
                All information needed should be prompted
                in the form, extra information will be discussed
                on email. After filling in a form, just wait!
                It won't take long before we get back to you
                and discuss the schedule, inventory and 
                transportation details.
